bugfixes:
  - :code:`icingaweb2_roles` was not deployed at all if :code:`icingaweb2_admin_username` and :code:`icingaweb2_admin_password` were missing.
    Now for both, the predefined admin role and user-defined :code:`icingaweb2_roles`, the respective variables are tested for correctly when creating :code:`roles.ini`.
    Thus, the creation of an initial admin user is no longer strictly necessary.
  - A short example for the previously undocumented :code:`icingaweb2_roles` has been added.
