    The Icinga2 API feature now allows for the use of certificates already present on the remote host.
    This means that certificates (and the key) no longer have to be present on the Ansible controller
    which allows for more flexibility when it comes to certificate deployment.
    The new behavior can be activated by setting :code:`ssl_remote_source: true` within the API feature.
  - For Icinga2 certificates and key file permissions are now set explicitly when using self generated certificates (**0644** and **0600** respectively).
