bugfixes:
  - "The IfW :code:`InstallCommand` now uses double quotes around the JSON to avoid timeouts during the task (#432).
    The JSON is also properly parsed and put into a single line to further avoid unwanted behavior.
    Thanks @afeefghannam89 for bringing up the topic again and testing the fix."
