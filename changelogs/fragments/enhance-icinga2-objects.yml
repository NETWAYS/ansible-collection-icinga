    The performance of the action plugin :code:`icinga2_object` has been greatly improved.
    Instead of writing individual objects to files and later merging them,
    they are instead now merged in memory on a per destination basis.
    This means that configuration files no longer have to be assembled after the fact.

    This also drops the :code:`order` parameter previously used to define the order in which
    objects are written if they belong to the same destination file.
    The new behavior only changes the order in the files but does not change the end result.

    A performance gain of up to 80% has been seen in testing.

  - |
    With the changes in :code:`icinga2_object` arises a problem.
    The prior directory structure within :code:`icinga2_fragments_path` (default: :code:`/var/tmp/icinga/`) does not fit the new approach for writing configuration files.
    Some paths that would become directories before are now treated as files.
    If the old directory structure is present on a remote host, deployment with the new method will most likely fail due to this.

    If the execution of :code:`icinga2_object` fails, deleting :code:`icinga2_fragments_path` should fix the problem.
    This, however, is a manual step that needs to be done.
