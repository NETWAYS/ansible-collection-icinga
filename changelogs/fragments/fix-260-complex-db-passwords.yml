    More complex database passwords have been an issue when importing database schemas. The passwords are now properly quoted using the :code:`quote` filter.
    This means that passwords containing characters such as :code:`#` and :code:`\` should now work correctly.

    The change affects Icinga 2 (IDO), Icinga for Kubernetes, Icinga DB and Icinga Web 2.
