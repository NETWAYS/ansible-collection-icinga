      - A list of Component names that should be installed / removed.
      - If O(state=present), a Component will be installed if not already present.
      - If O(state=absent), a Component will be removed if present.
      - If O(state=latest), a Component will be installed if not already present with the latest version.
      - Each list entry can use the syntax of C(<NAME>:<VERSION>) to install Component C(<NAME>) in version C(<VERSION>). C(<NAME>:latest) will evaluate to the appropriate version for the given Component. C(<NAME>:) is the same as C(<NAME>:latest).
      - If O(state=present) or O(state=latest), the above syntax takes precedence. This means that specifying a version should always result in that specific version of the component being installed. Has no impact if O(state=absent).
